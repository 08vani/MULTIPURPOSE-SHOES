# MULTIPURPOSE-SHOES

This is the project made for the course Protyping Interactive Systems. 
The shoes are capable of counting steps, bringing out waterproof material on a single click, showing the location and lighting LED lights when required.
The functioning of the shoes can be seen from the link below.
